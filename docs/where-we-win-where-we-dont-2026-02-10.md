# Where We Win / Where We Don't

**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Use:** Sales and qualification guide for pilot conversations.

## Where We Win

1. Strict offline/security requirements
- Buyer needs true on-prem or tightly isolated private deployment.
- Value: clear fit for air-gapped runtime and controlled data boundaries.

2. SMB and mid-market teams with budget pressure
- Buyer needs predictable monthly pricing and low procurement friction.
- Value: lower entry point than most enterprise knowledge platforms.

3. Operations-led buyers without ML platform teams
- Buyer has limited engineering bandwidth for DIY stack maintenance.
- Value: faster time-to-value with implementation support.

4. Document-heavy operational workflows
- Legal, manufacturing, financial operations, agriculture, landscaping.
- Value: reduced time searching SOPs/process docs, faster onboarding, better consistency.

5. High-touch support expectations
- Buyer wants responsive help during rollout and iteration.
- Value: service quality as a core differentiator versus DIY or large vendors.

## Where We Don't (Or Need Strong Proof)

1. Cloud-first standardization without air-gap requirement
- If buyer is fully committed to Snowflake/Azure/AWS and accepts cloud exposure, cloud-native tools may win.

2. Brand-first enterprise procurement
- Large enterprises may default to incumbent platform vendors for perceived risk reduction.

3. Feature-max buyers seeking broad ecosystem lock-in
- Buyers prioritizing extensive marketplace/integration depth may prefer hyperscaler suites.

4. Highly custom internal AI teams
- Teams with deep internal capability may choose OSS + in-house build path.

## Win Themes (Use In Messaging)

1. Security fit:
- "Built for environments where internet-independent runtime matters."

2. Cost fit:
- "Predictable pricing and lower total ownership burden for SMB operations."

3. Execution fit:
- "Production outcomes, not framework assembly."

4. Service fit:
- "Hands-on rollout and ongoing support instead of self-service complexity."

## Qualify Fast: 6 Questions

1. Is on-prem or private VPC a hard requirement?
2. Is internet-independent runtime required by policy or risk posture?
3. Does your team have bandwidth to own a DIY RAG stack?
4. Is predictable monthly cost required for approval?
5. Is reducing search/onboarding time an active objective this quarter?
6. Who owns budget and technical sign-off?

## Red Flags

1. "We only buy from hyperscalers" with no exception path.
2. "We already have a funded internal RAG engineering squad."
3. "No measurable business problem to solve in next 90 days."
4. "Security constraints are optional and cloud-only is preferred."

## Recommended Sales Motion By Fit

1. High fit:
- Move directly to technical scoping + pilot proposal.

2. Medium fit:
- Run a focused discovery and decision workshop before proposal.

3. Low fit:
- Disqualify early or park for future if constraints change.

## What To Prove In Every Pilot

1. Time-to-first-usable-answer
2. Reduction in document search time
3. Onboarding acceleration
4. Access-control correctness under real user roles
5. Operator adoption and support load
