# Outbound Messaging Pack (West Coast Pilot Acquisition)

**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Goal:** Support 6 paid pilots by September 16, 2026  
**Core offer:** Air-gapped enterprise knowledge RAG, `$850/month`, 6-month pilot  
**Primary buyer:** Operations leader

## 1) Positioning Core

Primary message:
- "Air-gapped knowledge assistant with predictable SMB pricing and direct support."

Three value pillars:
1. Security: offline/on-prem or private VPC deployment
2. Cost: predictable monthly pricing for SMB reality
3. Service: hands-on rollout and operator enablement

## 2) Cold Email Sequence (4 Steps)

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

Subject options:
- `Quick question on document search bottlenecks`
- `Air-gapped knowledge assistant for [Company]`
- `Reducing onboarding/search time without cloud exposure`

Body:

Hi [First Name],  

I work with teams that lose time to internal document search, slow onboarding, and inconsistent process execution.  

We built an air-gapped knowledge assistant that runs on-prem/private VPC (no internet dependency for runtime) with a predictable SMB-friendly price model.  

If useful, I can share a short walkthrough focused on [industry] operations workflows.  

Open to a 20-minute call next week?  

[Your Name]

### Email 2: Follow-Up (Value Clarification)

Subject:
- `Re: reducing ops search/onboarding time`

Body:

Hi [First Name],  

Following up in case this is relevant: we’re helping operations teams cut time spent finding SOPs, training docs, and process references while keeping knowledge inside controlled infrastructure.  

Typical pilot structure is simple: 6 months at $850/month with setup + onboarding support included.  

Would you like a 1-page summary?

### Email 3: Social/Use-Case Nudge

Subject:
- `[Industry] workflow use case`

Body:

Hi [First Name],  

One specific use case we’re seeing: frontline teams ask natural-language questions and get policy/process answers with citations from internal docs, instead of manual searching.  

If you want, I can show a short demo tailored to [legal/manufacturing/financial/agriculture/landscaping] workflows.  

Worth a quick call?  

[Your Name]

### Email 4: Breakup / Close Loop

Subject:
- `Close the loop?`

Body:

Hi [First Name],  

I haven’t heard back, so I’ll close the loop for now.  

If reducing document-search time or speeding onboarding becomes a priority, I can share the pilot brief and deployment options (on-prem/private VPC).  

Either way, thanks for taking a look.  

[Your Name]

## 3) LinkedIn Message Sequence

Connection note:
- `Hi [Name], I work on air-gapped knowledge systems for ops teams. Sharing ideas on reducing internal document search time.`

Message 1 (after acceptance):
- `Thanks for connecting. If useful, I can send a short summary of how teams deploy an offline/on-prem knowledge assistant for SOP and onboarding workflows.`

Message 2:
- `If this is timely, I can walk through a 20-minute demo tailored to [industry] operations.`

## 4) Discovery Call Script (20-30 Minutes)

### Opening (2 min)
- "Goal today is to understand your operational bottlenecks and determine if an air-gapped pilot makes sense."

### Current State (8 min)
1. How do teams currently find internal process knowledge?
2. Where are the biggest delays (search, onboarding, process handoff)?
3. What systems store the critical documents today?
4. What security/deployment constraints are non-negotiable?

### Impact + Urgency (8 min)
1. How much time is lost weekly to document search?
2. What happens when key people leave or are unavailable?
3. What is the cost of process inconsistency or rework?
4. What timeline are you targeting for improvement?

### Qualification (5 min)
1. Is on-prem/private VPC required?
2. Who owns budget and technical approval?
3. Is a 6-month paid pilot acceptable?
4. What would define pilot success internally?

### Close (3-5 min)
- Propose next step: technical scoping + pilot proposal.
- Confirm stakeholders and timeline.

## 5) Demo Flow (15 Minutes)

1. Show document ingestion and access control model.
2. Ask 2-3 realistic operations questions from their workflow.
3. Show grounded answers with citations.
4. Demonstrate role-restricted retrieval behavior.
5. Close with deployment architecture and pilot timeline.

## 6) Objection Handling Snippets

Objection: "We can build this ourselves."
- Response: "That can work, especially for engineering-heavy teams. We usually win when time-to-value, governance, and ongoing support matter more than framework assembly."

Objection: "Why not just use our cloud provider tools?"
- Response: "If cloud-only is acceptable, those tools can be good options. Our fit is when air-gapped or strict private deployment is required with predictable operating cost."

Objection: "Price concern."
- Response: "We designed pricing for SMB predictability: $850/month with rollout support, instead of large upfront platform commitments."

Objection: "No proof yet?"
- Response: "Fair point. We treat pilots as measurable outcomes projects with baseline and post-launch KPIs shared at each milestone."
