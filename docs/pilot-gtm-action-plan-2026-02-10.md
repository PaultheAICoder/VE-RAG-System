# Pilot GTM Action Plan (March 16 - September 16, 2026)

**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Goal:** 6 paid pilots by September 16, 2026  
**Pricing baseline:** $850/month per engagement, 6-month pilot  
**Budget cap:** <$10,000 total  
**Max CAC target:** $1,500 per paid pilot  
**Primary buyer:** Operations leader  
**Primary wedge:** Air-gapped security + lower total cost + customer service

## 1) Quant Targets

- Paid pilots target: `6`
- Top-of-funnel target (qualified opportunities): `24`
- Proposal target: `12`
- Close rate plan: `50%` from proposal to paid pilot
- Revenue at pilot start cohort target:
  - `6 x $850 = $5,100 MRR` equivalent while active

## 2) ICP Prioritization (West Coast First)

Priority verticals for first 6 pilots:
1. Legal
2. Manufacturing
3. Financial services
4. Agriculture
5. Landscaping

Ideal first-customer profile:
- 20-300 employees
- Document-heavy workflows
- Clear operational bottleneck in search/onboarding/process consistency
- Security-sensitive environment where cloud hesitation exists

## 3) Offer Design (Pilot Package)

Pilot package (default):
- Duration: 6 months
- Price: $850/month
- Deployment: on-prem or private VPC
- Includes:
  - Setup + integration support
  - Initial knowledge base ingestion
  - Operator onboarding
  - Monthly optimization review

Pilot acceptance criteria:
- Access control and audit requirements met
- Baseline and post-launch KPI tracking enabled
- Named operational owner on customer side

## 4) Messaging Framework

Primary message:
- "Deploy an air-gapped knowledge assistant with predictable SMB pricing and hands-on support."

Pain-to-value statements:
- Reduce time spent searching internal docs
- Improve onboarding speed for new staff
- Standardize execution of repeat processes
- Reduce knowledge loss from turnover

Proof gap (current state):
- No public case studies yet
- Compensate with structured pilot KPI reporting and milestone reviews

## 5) Channel Mix (Budget-Constrained)

Use a mixed acquisition approach:
1. Direct outbound (email + LinkedIn + warm intros)
2. Local networking/events (Portland and nearby)
3. Referral partners (MSPs/IT consultants serving SMB)

Suggested budget split (<$10k total):
- Outbound tooling + data: `$2,000`
- Events/networking/sponsorships: `$3,000`
- Partner enablement + collateral: `$1,500`
- Pilot demo assets + technical prep: `$2,000`
- Contingency: `$1,500`

## 6) Weekly Execution Cadence

Weeks 1-2 (pre-beta prep):
- Finalize pilot one-pager and pricing sheet
- Build outreach list of 120 accounts across target verticals
- Create discovery script and ROI calculator
- Set CRM stages and KPI dashboard

Weeks 3-6 (beta launch window):
- Run 30-40 outbound touches per week
- Book 3-5 discovery calls per week
- Conduct 2 demo sessions per week
- Submit at least 1 proposal per week

Weeks 7-12:
- Prioritize fastest-moving 10 opportunities
- Start first 2 paid pilots
- Capture before/after operational baselines
- Convert pilot feedback into objection-handling updates

Weeks 13-18:
- Close pilots 3-4
- Expand partner referrals
- Publish first anonymized pilot outcome summaries

Weeks 19-26:
- Close pilots 5-6
- Run conversion planning for annual contracts
- Compile repeatable onboarding playbook

## 7) Funnel KPI Targets

Weekly leading indicators:
- New outbound contacts: `30+`
- Discovery calls: `3+`
- Demos: `2+`
- Proposals: `1+`

Monthly conversion checkpoints:
- Discovery -> Demo: `>=50%`
- Demo -> Proposal: `>=50%`
- Proposal -> Paid pilot: `>=50%`

Cost checkpoints:
- Blended CAC per paid pilot: `<= $1,500`
- If CAC exceeds threshold for 4+ weeks, pause low-yield channels and reallocate spend

## 8) Risk Register + Mitigations

Risk: No early proof points
- Mitigation: enforce KPI instrumentation from day 1 of each pilot

Risk: DIY alternatives viewed as "good enough"
- Mitigation: sell time-to-value and operational support, not only technical capability

Risk: Long security reviews
- Mitigation: pre-package security architecture brief and deployment checklist

Risk: Budget friction in SMB
- Mitigation: clear fixed monthly pricing and phased rollout option

## 9) Sales Assets Required

Must-have assets:
1. One-page pilot brief
2. Security/deployment architecture brief (air-gapped)
3. ROI worksheet for operations leaders
4. Competitive comparison one-pager (top 5 alternatives)
5. Objection handling script

## 10) 30-Day Action Sprint (Immediate)

1. Build list of top 120 West Coast accounts in priority verticals.
2. Launch outreach to first 40 accounts.
3. Book 10 discovery calls.
4. Run 6 demos.
5. Submit 3 pilot proposals.
6. Close first 1-2 paid pilots.

## 11) Success Definition By September 16, 2026

- `6` paid pilots closed
- CAC at or below `$1,500` per pilot
- Pilot KPI evidence pack created for at least `3` active pilots
- Conversion pipeline built for post-pilot annual agreements
