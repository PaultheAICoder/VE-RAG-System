## Suggested Review Workflow

1. Start with interactive demos (Elastic, Weaviate, Qdrant) to assess interaction patterns.
2. Review screenshot-heavy repos (Azure sample, Haystack demos) for layout and UX structure.
3. Use videos to evaluate narrative flow and admin/operator journeys.
4. Track findings in a simple grid:
   - Navigation model
   - Query input UX
   - Citation/source display
   - Session/history handling
   - Admin controls
   - Trust/safety cues
