# Learned Patterns

*Patterns will be extracted from postmortems using `/learn` command.*

## How to Build Your Pattern Library

1. Complete issues using `/orchestrate <issue_number>`
2. When issues fail or have problems, create postmortems in `.claude/memory/postmortems/`
3. Run `/learn` to extract patterns from postmortems
4. Patterns are automatically loaded on session start
